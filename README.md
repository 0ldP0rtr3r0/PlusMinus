# Python Algorithms
Repository I use to solve & record problems in a wide range of Computer 
Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial 
intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like 
functional programming.


# plusMinus
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are 
positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on 
a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are 
scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to  
10 ^ -4 are acceptable.

# miniMaxSum
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can 
be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the 
respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated 
long integers.

# timeConversion
Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note:   - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
        - 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
